# Audio fingerprinting

Learning all about audio fingerprinting by reimplementing it

# Langiage stack

1. Python - Actual CPU intensive fingerprinting logic (Using librosa for audio analysis and signal processing)
2. Java - FrontEnd (Android Application)
3. React - If i am successful with the frontend, might implement web based version
4. JavaScript (Node.JS and Express.JS) - For backend processing
5. postgreSQL - For database
6. Spofify API - Retrieve information once match is detected

# IMPORTANT

Only copyright free audio has been used for this project, so quite limited. Seems like spotify allow music to be listened for free
